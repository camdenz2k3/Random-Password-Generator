# Random-Password-Generator
Week 3 challenge
After adding on to the starter code
I have created a random password generator that has the option to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters
The password can be between 8 and 128 characters long
This is a very useful tool if you need unique passwords for many things
just copy and paste and save
